#Credit Card Fraud Detection#

Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a major issue in financial transactions, requiring an effective fraud detection mechanism. This project aims to build a classification model that identifies fraudulent transactions while maintaining high accuracy and minimizing false positives.

Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning-based fraud detection system that analyzes credit card transactions to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, class imbalance handling, and model evaluation.

Objectives

Develop a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions efficiently.

Dataset Features: Includes transaction amount, timestamps, merchant details, and other key attributes.

Handle class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful patterns like transaction frequency, location mismatches, and spending behaviors.

Model Evaluation: Use precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.

Expected Outcome: A fraud detection model that minimizes false positives while ensuring high detection accuracy.

Deliverable: A GitHub repository with structured code, data preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation details.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of credit card transaction details with the following key attributes:

Time: Seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

Transaction Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.

Merchant Details: Information about the merchant involved in the transaction.

Features V1-V28: Anonymized principal components obtained from PCA transformation.

Fraud Label: A binary indicator where 1 represents a fraudulent transaction and 0 represents a legitimate one.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values and normalize numerical features.

Encode categorical variables if applicable.

Scale features using standardization techniques.

Class Imbalance Handling

Apply SMOTE to balance fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Feature Engineering

Compute transaction frequency per user.

Detect location mismatches.

Identify unusual spending behaviors.

Model Selection & Training

Visualize results using confusion matrices and performance curves.

Expected Outcome

A fraud detection model with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

A structured repository containing:

Cleaned and processed dataset.

Preprocessing scripts.

Model training and evaluation code.

Documentation and analysis insights.
